# Notre-Dame-Projects
This repository contains 3 class projects I have completed during my time at Notre Dame. The first, MATLAB code for modeling a counter current heat exchanger, I wrote during the spring of my freshman year for my Introduction to Engineering class. The second MATLAB project determines the 90% confidence interval (by the Monte Carlo method) for the dimensionless diffusivity parameter K from a set of given data. I wrote this as the final project for my Numerical and Statistical Analysis course, which I took during the spring of my sophomore year. The final class project here included in this repository is a Python notebook which models PID control of a wind turbine. This was a group project completed during the spring of my junior year. I wrote the code for the calculations pieces.
